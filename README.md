# School Platform Usage Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the usage of an online platform by teachers and students in various schools. The data is obtained from three sources: "Teacher Activity", "Student Activity", and "Data Dictionary". The objective is to understand how effectively the platform is being utilized and to provide insights for improving usage.

## Contents
1. **Code Files**:
    - `b.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
    - `data.xlsx`: Excel file containing the dataset.
2. **Data Files**:
    - `data.xlsx`: Contains three sheets: "Teacher Activity", "Student Activity", and "Data Dictionary".
3. **Documentation**:
    - `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
4. **Results**:
    - Analysis results and visualizations are generated within the Jupyter Notebook (`b.ipynb`).

## Instructions
1. **Setup**:
    - Ensure Python and necessary libraries (pandas, sqlite3, matplotlib, seaborn) are installed.
    - Open the Jupyter Notebook `b.ipynb`.
2. **Data Loading**:
    - The Notebook loads data from the `data.xlsx` file into SQLite tables.
3. **Analysis**:
    - SQL queries are executed to extract insights from the data.
    - Data visualizations are generated using matplotlib and seaborn.
4. **Results**:
    - Interpret the analysis results and visualizations to gain insights into school platform usage.
5. **Further Exploration**:
    - Modify the analysis code as needed for additional insights.
6. **Documentation**:
    - Update this README file to reflect any changes or additions to the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
